    <p>Today calzones are most commonly stuffed with the exact same toppings that go on a pizza which, besides the crust issue, was one of my main problems with it. I mean, why not just fold a pizza in half, and call it a day? So, I decided to do what I hear is a more traditional filling featuring ricotta, fresh mozzarella, and ham. The result was as enjoyable as it was surprising. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>24 ounces prepared pizza dough </li>
        <li>8 slices prosciutto </li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese, drained </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
        <li>1 ½ cups finely diced smoked ham </li>
        <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced, drained on paper towels </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornmeal </li>
        <li>1 egg </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese </li>
        <li>2 cups marinara sauce for dipping, heated (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 4 equal portions; shape each into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, flatten each dough ball into a flat circle and roll out into an 8- or 9-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Place 2 prosciutto slices on one half of each circle of dough, leaving a 1-inch empty border. Spoon ricotta cheese on prosciutto. Season with a pinch of salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. Top with chopped ham, mozzarella slices, and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Moisten edge of dough with a bit of water using your fingertip. Fold the empty half of the dough over the filling and lightly seal edges. Crimp the edges up to completely seal the calzone.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle lined baking sheet with cornmeal. Transfer calzones to baking sheet. Cut several small slits in the top of the crust with the tip of a knife to allow for venting.</li>
        <li>Beat egg with water to make egg wash. Brush the calzones with egg wash. Dust with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Remove excess cornmeal and grated cheese from around calzones to avoid smoke from the hot oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes before serving. Serve with heated marinara sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
