    <p>Vito Authentic Italian Spaghetti recipe comes straight from Italy. Tomatoes, basil, onions, and carrots flavor the meat to make the perfect sauce!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 carrots peeled, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork (optional)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds tomatoes (fresh peeled and diced tomatoes or canned San Marzano tomatoes)</li>
        <li>6 fresh basil leaves chopped (or 1-2 tsp. dried basil)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>beef broth (if needed, to taste)</li>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil on medium heat in a large, deep skillet. Add onion, carrots, and garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add ground beef and pork and continue to cook.</li>
        <li>When meat is browned and onions are soft, add tomatoes.</li>
        <li>When tomatoes have softened and have started to release their juices (about 4-5 min) add basil, sugar, salt and pepper (if you are whole tomatoes, mash the them with a potato masher or spatula to release all their juices).</li>
        <li>Simmer for at least 3 hours (and up to 6 hours), stirring occasionally. The longer you simmer, the better. Important: tomatoes burn easily so keep an eye on them and add beef broth a little at a time to thin sauce if needed. </li>
        <li>In a large pot, cook spaghetti in salted water to al dente, drain completely and return to pot. Add sauce to the spaghetti noodles and toss until noodles are covered.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
